## Outsourced Computation

- Data is transferred among several individual entities in a distributed system
  - data calculation, management, etc.
  - handeled by both known entities (endpoints) and unknown entities (in-betweens)
- Cloud-based services
  - hardware, OS, softwarem apps...
  - storage, computation, databases, analyitics...
  - *aaS- Everything as a Service
- Transformative multi-platform tech
  - business, organizations, indiivudals
  - client-server, distributed, P2P, Web-based
  - example- internet protocols
- Security consequences
  - fact: untrusted interactions
    - information is processed outside one's administration controll or "trust perimeter"
  - risk: falsified/leaked information
    - information may be unintentionally altered or shared with unauthorized entities
  - goal: integrity/privacy safeguards for outsourced assets
    - need to protect information against change, damgage/unauthorized access
  - threats
    - misconfigurations, erroneous failures, limited liability
    - economic incentives of cost-cutting providers
    - compromises, attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Limited liability
  - companies are not legally responsible for lost data

## Advanced Persistent Threats

- sophisticated well-targeted cyber-attack campaigns
- employ rich attack vectors and highly adaptive strategies
  - social engineering
  - zero-day vulnerabilities
  - low-and-slow progression
  - intelligence
- all of these are extremely hard-to-defend or even hard-to-detectentities
- recent examples- RSA, Bit9, Dyn, Equifax
- Verizon's annual Data Breach Investigations Report
- "new" big threat is data manipulation
